### Option 3: GitHub Integration

2. In Apify Console, connect your GitHub account
3. Create new actor and select "GitHub" as source
4. Select your repository
5. Apify will automatically sync and build

## Configuration Tips

### Proxy Settings
- **Free accounts**: Use Apify Proxy with datacenter IPs
- **Paid accounts**: Use residential proxies for better success rate
- Configure in input: `"useApifyProxy": true`

### Rate Limiting
- Start with `maxResultsPerSearch: 10-20` to test
- Increase gradually based on your needs
- Watch for Google Maps rate limits

### Cost Optimization
- Each search query consumes compute units
- Fewer cities/categories = lower cost
- Use specific searches rather than broad ones

## Monitoring

- View logs in real-time during actor runs
- Check dataset for scraped results
- Monitor compute unit usage in account dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Actor Fails to Build
- Check `package.json` syntax
- Ensure all files are properly uploaded
- Review build logs for specific errors

### No Results Returned
- Verify proxy configuration
- Check if searches are too specific
- Review actor logs for error messages

### Duplicate Results
- The deduplication logic should handle this
- Check if placeId is being captured correctly

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Schedule regular runs (Apify Scheduler)
2. Export data to Google Sheets, CSV, or JSON
3. Integrate with webhooks for automation
4. Build enrichment pipeline (step 2)
